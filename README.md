### Sharecost

Sharecost allows you to split the cost of any purchase! Login with your Venmo account and add your friends to a purchase!

# Instructions for Aaron:

Log in with Venmo and create a purchase that you would like to split evenly with a group of people. Currently, as of iter2, they need to have also logged in to sharecost before for it to work AND they also need to be your friends on Venmo. For example, if you (Aaron) login in to sharecost.meteor.com you can create a new purchase and invite Trent or Nathan to that purchase since they (1) have accounts on sharecost and (2) are your friends on Venmo.

# Testing:

Testing only takes place when you run `meteor run` locally on your own machine in this projects directory. It fires up Velocity which you can see as a blue or green dot in the top right hand corner of the screen. The tests usually take about 30 seconds to fully run.

To run without tests:
JASMINE_SERVER_UNIT=0 JASMINE_SERVER_INTEGRATION=0 JASMINE_CLIENT_UNIT=0 JASMINE_CLIENT_INTEGRATION=0 meteor
